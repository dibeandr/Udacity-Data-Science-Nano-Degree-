# Online Shopping


## Project Motivation
 As the digital wave transforms consumer habits, online shopping data offers a treasure trove of insights. 

 In the realm of online shopping, retail clients often contemplate the swiftness of delivery compared to the immediacy of in-store purchases. The available data delves into the geographical locations of each online transaction, elucidating sales trends on a monthly basis. Key questions addressed include identifying the country with the highest online purchases, its percentage relative to others, determining the month with the most transactions by revenue (or clicks), and discerning the most frequently sold items online. This analysis aims to provide insights into consumer behavior and preferences in the online retail landscape.

 Thanks to kaggle for the data set that help with simple columns of Country of Purchase, Product and Quantity, thus helping to plot Revenue(P x Q), bringing us to questions:Â 
Which Country has the highest online purchases?
What is the fast-selling item from the stock list
Which month did the retail makes highest revenue?
