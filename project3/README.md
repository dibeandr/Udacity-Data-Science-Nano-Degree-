## IBM, The Recommendations Project:

### Installations

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib.pyplot

scikit-learn

This project leverages multiple Python libraries, including matplotlib for data visualization, pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, seaborn for statistical graphics, and scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms. Through these, we perform comprehensive data analysis and build a recommendation model.

## Summary
This project involves the following key tasks to develop a recommendation system:

1. ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
we conduct a thorough analysis of the provided dataset. This involves examining the shape of the dataset, the number of articles, users, and other key features. The objective is to understand the underlying structure and characteristics of the data.

2. ### Rank-Based Recommendations
To develop a recommendation system based on the popularity of articles. This method ranks articles by the number of interactions they have received. The most popular articles are recommended to new users, as they would like to see what others are watching already.

3. ### User-User Collaborative Filtering
To build more personalised recommendations, we use collaborative filtering. This technique involves identifying users with similar interaction history and recommending articles to a user based on what similar users have liked prior. The users receive content tailored to their preferences.

4. ### Matrix Factorisation
we use matrix factorisation techniques to finetune and improve the accuracy of our recommendations. This method decomposes the user-item interaction matrix, capturing latent features that explain observed interactions. This approach is particularly useful for handling sparse datasets and uncovering deeper patterns in user behaviour.

By combining these techniques, we aim to create a recommendation system that is both effective and scalable, leveraging the power of data science to enhance user experience.
